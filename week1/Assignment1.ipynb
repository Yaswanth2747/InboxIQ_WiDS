    "# Python Basics Assignment: Introduction and Setup  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Python Basics Assignment**! This assignment is designed to test your foundational knowledge of Python and essential libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy**. These libraries are widely used for data analysis, visualization, and numerical computations, making them invaluable for any programmer or data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will:  \n",
    "1. Strengthen your understanding of Python programming.  \n",
    "2. Gain hands-on experience with popular Python libraries.  \n",
    "3. Enhance your ability to manipulate data and create insightful visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites  \n",
    "Before starting, ensure that you have **Python 3.7 or later** installed on your system. If not, follow the instructions below.\n",

    "## Installation Steps  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Python  \n",
    "1. Download the latest Python version from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  \n",
    "2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:  \n",
    "   - **Windows**: During installation, ensure the checkbox **\"Add Python to PATH\"** is selected.  \n",
    "   - **Mac/Linux**: Use the package manager or installer suitable for your system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Required Libraries  \n",
    "Use the `pip` package manager to install the required libraries. Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and run the following commands:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas matplotlib numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 3: Verify Installation\n",
    "You can verify your installations by running the following code and checking the versions of the installed libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Pandas version:\", pd.__version__)\n",
    "print(\"Matplotlib version:\", plt.__version__)\n",
    "print(\"NumPy version:\", np.__version__)\n",
