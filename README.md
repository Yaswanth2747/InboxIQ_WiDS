This project aims to classify emails as ham or spam using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, enhancing inbox filtering to protect users from unwanted messages. By leveraging NLP models, we’ll analyze email content, identify distinctive patterns, and accurately differentiate between legitimate (ham) and spam messages, contributing to improved email security and a better user experience.

Welcome to this exciting winter project! We’re thrilled to have you join us as we explore the powerful applications of data science in email classification. A detailed project breakdown is available in the Overview file—please take some time to review it as it outlines each phase of the project. Rest assured, our team is here to support you every step of the way. Let’s work together to make this a rewarding and insightful experience!
